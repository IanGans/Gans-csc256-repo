## Prompt 1

### **Prompt:**

I am working on a group project that requires integrating at least four internal APIs and one public API using Python and Flask. I want to structure the development to include multiple backend programs, one of which must connect to a database. The frontend will use only static HTML pages. What would be the best approach to designing this system?

### **Response:**

You can create multiple Flask applications that serve as microservices, each exposing their own RESTful APIs. One service can manage user authentication, another can handle a task management system, and a third can serve as an employee directory tied to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite). The public API (e.g., a weather API) can be accessed from one of the internal services and exposed to the frontend. Flask's `Blueprints` can help organize routes effectively, and an API gateway can facilitate communication between services.

## Prompt 2

### **Prompt:**

How can I ensure my development follows SOLID principles and best practices while implementing OOP?

### **Response:**

To adhere to SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class and function should have a distinct purpose (e.g., separate database access logic from business logic).
- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Design modules that can be extended without modifying existing code, such as using abstract base classes.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Use inheritance properly by ensuring derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base class.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Keep interfaces minimal so that classes only implement necessary methods.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations to promote flexibility and testing.

Using Flask with Blueprints, SQLAlchemy for database ORM, and well-defined service classes will help maintain a clean structure.

## Prompt 3

### **Prompt:**

Can I use Python to call backend APIs?

### **Response:**

Yes, Python provides multiple ways to call backend APIs. The `requests` library is commonly used for making HTTP requests, while Flask itself allows internal communication between APIs via service-to-service calls. Example:

```python
import requests
response = requests.get("http://localhost:5001/api/data")
print(response.json())
```

For more complex applications, using `gRPC` or `GraphQL` can improve efficiency.

## Prompt 4

### **Prompt:**

Would structuring the project this way make collaboration among 3-6 developers easier while reducing version control conflicts?

### **Response:**

Yes, breaking the project into separate services allows different team members to work independently on various components without interfering with each other. Using Git with feature branches, pull requests, and CI/CD pipelines helps manage conflicts and maintain quality. Defining clear API contracts using OpenAPI (Swagger) ensures smooth integration across different services.

## Prompt 5

### **Prompt:**

How can I implement parallel testing using pytest, Selenium, Playwright, Postman, and Robot Framework?

### **Response:**

Parallel testing can be achieved by:

- **pytest**: Using `pytest-xdist` to run unit tests concurrently.
- **Selenium & Playwright**: Running UI tests in headless mode across multiple browsers.
- **Postman**: Using Newman CLI to execute API tests in parallel.
- **Robot Framework**: Configuring parallel execution with `Pabot`.
- **CI/CD**: Leveraging GitHub Actions or Jenkins to distribute test execution.

## Prompt 6

### **Prompt:**

My project will include a task management application, a weather application using a public API, and an employee directory with a database. All will be accessible via the web. Can you provide a detailed project plan for a team of 3-6 members?

### **Response:**

**Project Plan:**

1. **Week 1-2:** Define API contracts, set up Flask applications, database schema, and Git repository.
2. **Week 3-4:** Develop core functionalities for each service.
3. **Week 5-6:** Implement API integration and UI templates.
4. **Week 7:** Conduct unit, integration, and acceptance testing.
5. **Week 8:** Deploy to cloud (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and conduct final review.

## Prompt 7

### **Prompt:**

Can you extend this to include a student lab for teaching pytest, Selenium, Playwright, Postman, and Robot Framework?

### **Response:**

Yes, the lab will cover:

- Writing unit tests in pytest.
- Automating UI interactions using Selenium and Playwright.
- API testing with Postman.
- Creating Robot Framework test cases for end-to-end acceptance testing.

## Prompt 8

### **Prompt:**

What Selenium and Playwright test cases should we include?

### **Response:**

Tests should cover:

- Form submissions and validation
- Clicking buttons and links
- Dropdown selection
- Mouse and keyboard interactions
- Page navigation and layout verification
- CRUD operations and error handling

## Prompt 9

### **Prompt:**

Can you provide user stories for sprint planning and test case development?

### **Response:**

Example user stories:

- "As a user, I can add a task so that I can track my work."
- "As a user, I can view real-time weather updates from the public API."
- "As an admin, I can manage employee records in the directory."

These stories define acceptance criteria for Robot Framework and pytest test cases.

## Prompt 10

### **Prompt:**

Ensure student labs are covered.

### **Response:**

Student labs will be included, providing hands-on experience with testing tools.

## Prompt 11

### **Prompt:**

The application must follow maintainability, scalability, testability, and robustness principles. It should include at least one public API and four internal APIs.

### **Response:**

The application should:

- Use modular architecture for maintainability.
- Scale horizontally by deploying microservices separately.
- Have unit tests for testability.
- Implement exception handling and logging for robustness.

## Reflection

This project was a valuable learning experience in designing and implementing scalable applications with APIs, modular architecture, and robust testing strategies. Working collaboratively to integrate multiple internal APIs and one public API while maintaining principles of maintainability, scalability, testability, and robustness taught me the importance of systematic planning and adherence to software design principles.

The task of structuring a system with Flask microservices challenged me to think critically about modular design. Dividing the project into independent services allowed team members to focus on specific components, reducing version control conflicts and improving workflow efficiency. The integration of testing frameworks, including pytest, Selenium, Playwright, Postman, and Robot Framework, reinforced the significance of structured testing in software development.

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring smooth integration across APIs while adhering to SOLID principles. Designing clear API contracts using OpenAPI was crucial for reducing ambiguity. Implementing effective testing strategies across tools required extra research and experimentation, particularly in configuring parallel testing with pytest-xdist and Pabot for Robot Framework. Learning to automate tests for UI interactions, API endpoints, and end-to-end workflows was especially rewarding.

The project also highlighted the importance of scalability and modularity. By employing Flask Blueprints, SQLAlchemy for ORM, and robust exception handling, we created an application that was easy to maintain and extend. Deploying the application to the cloud demonstrated the value of horizontal scaling in microservices architecture.

Overall, this experience enhanced my ability to plan and execute large-scale projects while ensuring quality through effective testing. It also deepened my understanding of software design principles and the collaborative process of building modular systems. Moving forward, I plan to further develop my skills in API integration, test automation, and efficient team collaboration to deliver even more impactful projects.
